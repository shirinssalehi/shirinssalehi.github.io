### **Fair Ranking with Loss Regularization (Microsoft Research)**

Designed a novel loss-regularization-based approach that mitigates stereotypical gender bias in dense neural rankers without sacrificing utility.
(*Source: CV* )

### **NLP Applications for Real-World Text Analytics (Partdp.ai)**

Built pipelines for automated summarization, emotion extraction, and trend analysis across millions of user-generated texts.

## **Research Themes**

### **1. Fairness in Information Retrieval**

I design frameworks that reduce gender and social biases in ranking models, including:

* Bias-aware curriculum sampling
* Disentangled representations
* Regularization-based fairness
* Debiasing relevance judgments

### **2. Neural Ranking Models & Representation Learning**

My work examines how dense neural rankers encode semantics, query difficulty, and sensitive attributes, and develops better embedding spaces for ranking tasks.

### **3. Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval**

I study how RL can enhance low-resource or few-shot ranking tasks through policy optimization and self-training.

### **4. Multimodal Language Understanding**

Through the IGLU project, I work on vision–language models capable of reasoning over sequences of visual and textual inputs.

### **5. NLP for Decision-Making**

Applications include summarization, sentiment analysis, and emotion modeling for product and market analytics.
